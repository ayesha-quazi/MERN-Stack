mkdir => make directory (creates folders only)

• Flags: are characters that we pass with commands to modify their behaviour. 

~ manual (kaise kam krti hai woh command) command => man ls: gives info about 'ls' command ; man mkdir: gives info about 'mkdir' command.

~ with flags => 
ls -l: more info
ls -a: hidden files
ls -la: more info + hidden files.
